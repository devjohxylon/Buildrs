# Buildrs

**Where developers swipe right on their next collaboration.**

Buildrs is a web platform that connects developers who want to work on projects together. Think of it like a dating app, but for finding coding partners instead of dates.

## What is this?

- **Swipe through developers** looking for project partners
- **Match with people** who have complementary skills  
- **Chat and collaborate** on side projects, hackathons, or open source
- **Build cool shit together** instead of coding alone

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **In development** - We're building this thing and gathering early users.

The frontend is done and live. Working on the backend next (auth, matching, chat, etc).

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js (React + TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Progressive Web App (installable on mobile)

**Backend (Coming Soon):**
- FastAPI (Python)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for real-time features
- GitHub OAuth for login

## Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it.

## Deployment

- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Will be deployed on Railway
