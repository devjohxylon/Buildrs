# Buildrs

Ever wanted to build something cool but couldn't find the right people? Yeah me too. That's why I built this.

## What the hell is this?

Swipe through profiles, find people who want to build the same shit you do, and actually make something together 
instead of just talking about it.

### The Problem
- You have a cool project idea but no one to build it with
- You're tired of coding alone in your basement
- You want to learn new tech but don't know where to start

### The Solution
- Swipe through developer profiles
- Match with people who have complementary skills
- Chat, plan, and actually build stuff together
- No more "let's grab coffee" - let's write some code

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Still building this thing** - Frontend is done, backend is... well, it's getting there.

**What works:**
- âœ… Landing page (looks pretty good if I say so myself)
- âœ… Swipe interface (actually fun to use)
- âœ… Terminal UI theme (because why not)
- âœ… Mobile responsive (works on your phone)

**What I'm working on:**
- ðŸ”„ User authentication (GitHub OAuth)
- ðŸ”„ Real time chat
- ðŸ”„ Matching algorithm
- ðŸ”„ Project creation tools

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 (React + TypeScript) - because I like living on the edge
- Tailwind CSS - because writing CSS is boring
- Framer Motion - because animations are cool
- PWA - because why not make it installable

**Backend (Coming Soon):**
- FastAPI (Python) - because I'm too lazy to write boilerplate
- PostgreSQL - because SQL is still relevant
- Redis - for real-time stuff
- GitHub OAuth - because everyone has a GitHub account

## Contributing

Want to help? Cool. Here's how:

1. Fork this repo
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a PR
4. I'll probably merge it if it doesn't break everything

## The Story

I decided to build something that actually works for finding coding partners. No corporate BS, no fake networking, just developers finding other developers to build cool shit with.

**Built by a developer who was tired of coding alone**

*P.S. If you're reading this and thinking "this sounds cool but I don't know if I should join" just do it. Worst case scenario you waste 5 minutes. Best case scenario you find someone to build something amazing with.*
